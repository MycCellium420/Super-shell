OLAMO is a mobile-first AI-native operating shell built for autonomous agents — trade, hack, learn, build — from your pocket.

- Fully offline-capable (Termux, Android)
- Powered by Qwen3 0.6B
- Uses swarms-rs for autonomous agent orchestration
- Natural Language Interface (CLI-based)
- Built-in shell, file manipulation, and tool usage

Built for hackers, quants, and builders. Operate alone. Or spawn your swarm.
