# Project Super-Shell: The AI-Native Supershell

SUPER-SHELL is a mobile-first, AI-native operating shell designed for autonomous agents. It's a powerful, natural language-powered terminal that allows you to interact with your system, execute commands, run code, and manage AI agents with unprecedented ease and customizability.

## Vision

Super-Shell aims to be your ultimate AI-powered assistant, enabling you to:

- **Interact Natively:** Use natural language to command your system, eliminating the need for complex syntax.
- **LLM-Driven Orchestration:** The core of Super-Shell is an LLM that interprets your natural language commands, decides on the appropriate tools to use, executes them, and integrates their output into a coherent natural language response.
- **Empower Autonomous Agents:** Leverage built-in AI agents, powered by `swarms-rs`, for various tasks, from web searches to code execution and file manipulation. These agents can be spawned and managed directly by Super-Shell.
- **Bring Your Own AI:** Customize and integrate your preferred AI models and agents (e.g., Ollama).
- **Self-Improve:** Develop and enhance Super-Shell itself using its own AI capabilities.
- **Run Anywhere:** Designed for portability, initially focusing on offline capabilities on mobile (Termux, Android).

## Core Features

- **Natural Language Interface (CLI-based):** Command your system using intuitive, human-like language.
- **Built-in AI Agents:** Pre-configured agents for common tasks.
- **Customizable Agents:** Easily configure and integrate your own AI agents and models.
- **Tool-Enhanced Agents:** Agents equipped with a wide array of tools for:
    - **Shell Access:** Execute system commands.
    - **Code Execution:** Run and debug code snippets.
    - **File Manipulation:** Read, write, and manage files.
    - **Web Search:** Access and process information from the internet.
    - **And more...** (expandable toolset)
- **Offline Capability:** Designed to function effectively even without an internet connection.

## Powered By

- **Rust:** For performance, safety, and reliability.
- **Qwen3 0.6B (Planned):** For local, efficient AI processing.
- **swarms-rs:** For robust autonomous agent orchestration.

## Quickstart

```bash
# Coming soon
```
