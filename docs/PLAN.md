# Olamo-os Development Plan

This document outlines the development plan and technical roadmap for Olamo-os.

## Phase 1: Core Interpreter and REPL

- [ ] **Project Scaffolding:** Set up the initial Rust project structure with `cargo`.
- [ ] **CLI Interface:** Implement a basic REPL using `rustyline` for user input.
- [ ] **Command Parsing:** Create a simple command parser to handle basic commands.
- [ ] **Initial Documentation:** Write the initial `README.md` and `PLAN.md`.

## Phase 2: Model Integration and MCP

- [ ] **Qwen3 Integration:** Integrate the Qwen3 0.6B model for natural language understanding.
- [ ] **Model Context Protocol (MCP):** Implement the MCP for managing shared context between components.
- [ ] **Interpreter Logic:** Enhance the interpreter to use the Qwen3 model to understand user intent.
- [ ] **MCP Routing:** Implement the MCP router to direct requests to the appropriate modules.

## Phase 3: Agent and Tool Implementation

- [ ] **`swarms-rs` Integration:** Integrate `swarms-rs` for agent management.
- [ ] **Agent Spawning:** Implement the ability to spawn and manage agents via the MCP.
- [ ] **Tool Implementation:** Create basic tools for shell execution and file I/O.
- [ ] **Tool Integration:** Integrate the tools with the MCP so they can be used by agents.

## Phase 4: Advanced Features and Community Building

- [ ] **Web Search Tool:** Implement a tool for searching the web.
- [ ] **Multimodal I/O:** Integrate OpenCodex for multimodal input and output.
- [ ] **Community Building:** Promote the project on social media and developer forums.
- [ ] **Contribution Guidelines:** Create a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file to encourage contributions.
